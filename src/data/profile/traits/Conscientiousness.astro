        You value experiences much more than worldly success, and as such tend to be very laid-back. Instead of being
        goal-oriented, you prefer to bask in the moment. A free-spirit, you like to live life on the edge and defy
        society's conventions. Time, rules, all these things are just mental constructs, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Your fun-loving nature translates into a look that could lean into streetwear, party staples, a bohemian
        aesthetic or a rock 'n' roll, sensibility. Your concept of self-care is to do as little as possible and prefer
        brands that are natural and artisanal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, your preferences and lifestyle come from how your five scores work together - not from low
        conscientiousness alone - creating an identity that's uniquely yours.

        You're laid-back, like to live a bit on the edge, and tend to value experiences more than worldly success.
        Instead of always obsessing about long-term goals, you often prefer to bask in the moment. A free-spirit, you
        don't feel the need to always conform society's conventions. Time, rules, all these things are just mental
        constructs right?

        You're a hybrid of free-spirit and goal-getter, knowing when to shift from responsible mode to fun mode and back
        again. Sometimes you feel confused about what you value more: in-the-moment experiences or worldly success, but
        ultimately you've learned to embrace both sides of who you are. It's a good balance to have: hard-working, neat,
        and health-focused, but not obsessively so.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, your preferences and lifestyle tends to have plenty of contrasts. For example, you like to mix business
        and sporty separates - like a hoodie under a tailored jacket. Not easily derailed, you're able to context-switch
        quickly - one day you're out until late, the next day you're at the gym early.

        A natural go-getter, you enjoy planning out long-term goals, and working hard to achieve them. Generally
        organized and responsible, you tend to have a place for everything, and are mostly on top of all your paperwork
        and duties, from pension scheme to teeth cleaning. You tend to have a cautious streak, and prefer to think
        things through, but still know how to have fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, your style leans towards an adult-like aesthetic - tailored, crisp and neat - and you like clean
        lines in design. You're able to context-switch quickly - one day you're out until late, the next day you're at
        the gym. You appreciate high quality in all things.

        You excel at formulating long-term goals, then organizing, planning, and working consistently to achieve them.
        Meticulously organized and responsible, you have a place for everything, and are fully on top of all your
        paperwork, healthcare and duties, from pension scheme to teeth cleaning. You have a cautious streak, and like to
        think things through.

        Naturally, your style is adult-like, tailored, crisp and neat. You like clean lines in design, and keep your
        clothes in immaculate condition. You're sophisticated and like curated brands, and high quality in all things.
