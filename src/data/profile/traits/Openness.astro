        You're a classicist, and not a big fan of abstract ideas and new theories. You find people who are always
        flaunting intellectualism a bit pretentious. You're more analytical than imaginative, prefer real, tangible
        solutions, and opt for the tried-and-tested. You value traditions and tend to keep a social circle that you've
        cultivated over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your style is similarly conservative and traditional. You prefer time-tested brands, and like to look to classic
        style icons of the past. You're politically fairly conservative, and value routine and order in your lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, your preferences and lifestyle come from how your five scores work together - not from low openness
        alone - creating an identity that's uniquely yours.

        At times, you can feel highly creative, curious, and adventurous. At other times, you prefer routine, structure,
        and tradition. You are able to find a good balance between new ideas and simply being practical. When you are
        faced with a problem, you are able to consider tried-and true methods, but can also think outside the box. This
        equilibrium allows you to thoughtfully consider both innovative and established methods when addressing
        challenges, making you a versatile and effective problem-solver.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, your style has a good balance of both classic staples and more directional, trendier pieces. You like
        to mix it up when it comes to most things. When planning trips, you strike a balance between scheduled
        activities and spontaneous exploration, ensuring both structure and freedom. In the realm of politics, you
        maintain a centrist perspective, valuing diverse viewpoints and fostering balanced discussions.

        You're forward-thinking, not big on traditional theories, prefer to challenge the status quo, and are more
        liberal in your values. You're worldly, intellectually curious, and are generally receptive to abstract ideas
        and new cultures. Well-read and well-travelled, you're eager to know everything about everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you're creative and intellectual, you love designs that are a little bit distinctive. You crave novelty, love
        innovative new brands, and cherish your Gold status. If you're not already living in California, you should be.
        Style-wise, you tend to do wither minimalist or maximalist extremes.

      <p>
        You have a strong disdain for convention, are liberal in your values, and tend to be avant-garde in the way you
        live, work and think. You're worldly, intellectually curious, and love exploring abstract ideas and immersing
        yourself in new cultures. Highly well-read and well-travelled, you tend to know a little bit of everything about
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you're creative and intellectual, you tend to either dress very simply - think Steve Jobs or or Joan Didion -
        or with very out-there flair. You crave novelty, love innovative new brands, and cherish your Gold status. If
        you're not already living in California, you should be.
