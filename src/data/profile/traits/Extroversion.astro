        You probably knew this already, but you're introverted. You tend to be quiet and keep to yourself, and can
        easily feel over-stimulated if forced to spend too much time in social situations. On the shy side, having too
        much attention on you makes you feel uncomfortable, so you're happiest behind-the-scenes, or home with a good
        book. If you must socialize, you prefer one-on-ones with a good longtime friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        You like contemplative music that you can enjoy alone, and your sophisticated, simple style is also on the
        quieter side. You prefer vacations in remote places where you can enjoy unique scenery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, your preferences and lifestyle come from how your five scores work together - not from low
        extroversion alone - creating an identity that's uniquely yours.

        You're on the quiet side, tend to keep to yourself, and can feel over-stimulated after spending too much time
        with others. A bit reserved, having too much attention on you can make you feel uncomfortable, so you feel best
        behind-the-scenes, or at home with a good book. When catching up with people, you generally prefer small groups
        or a one-on-one with a good friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        You enjoy chill, contemplative music that makes you think, and your sophisticated, non-flashy style is also on
        the quieter, cerebral side. You prefer vacations in remote places where you can enjoy unique scenery.

        You love a good party as much as the next person, but can also feel easily depleted if you don't have quality
        alone time to recharge: it's a careful balance you've mastered over the years. Sometimes you feel excited about
        life and are eager to pencil-in plans, but often you have periods of lying low. It comes in waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because you're somewhere in the middle between extroversion and introversion, your style in respect to this
        trait is also balanced and varied. You're neither too loud or flashy nor too boring. You like slow and fast
        tempo music in equal measure. Depends on the mood.

        Seldom shy, you're usually the first to get up and dance and often the last one standing. You like to make plans
        and organize social events, and often have many chats and conversations on the go. You still enjoy your alone
        time, but socializing generally makes you feel even more energized than you already are. Most of the time, you
        like to talk through your problems with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, you tend to like statement styles and exuberant colors and details, fun new brands with distinctive
        identities, as well as energetic music.

        Never shy, you're always the first to get up and dance as well as the last person standing. With your explosive
        energy, you live to make plans and organize social events, and thrive off having many chats and conversations on
        the go. Socializing makes you feel energized, you're assertive, and you like to talking through issues with
        several different people.
