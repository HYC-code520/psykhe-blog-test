        Hello, contrarian. With a very strong sense of self, and a keen competitive streak, you generally like to focus
        on you, work best alone, believe modesty is overrated, and aren't into the whole group thing. Never afraid to
        voice an opinion, you love a good debate, whether on social media or at dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your every-person-for-themselves superhero style trickles down to a bold taste in fashion, music, and films with
        strong leading characters. You love manifesto-style reads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, your preferences and lifestyle come from how your five scores work together - not from low
        agreeableness alone - creating an identity that's uniquely yours.

        Hello, contrarian. With a strong sense of self and a slight competitive streak, you mostly like to focus on you,
        prefer to work alone, and aren't super into the whole group thing. It's easy for you to voice an opinion, and
        you love a good debate on topics you care about, whether on social media or at dinner.

        Your every-person-for-themselves superhero style trickles down to a bold taste in fashion, music, and films with
        strong leading characters. You love polarizing characters and reads.

        Lucky you: you're a good team player, but can also work independently. You're easy to get along with, but know
        how to stand up for yourself. You know when to lead, but are always happy to let others shine. You can argue
        your point when necessary, but also know which battles are worth picking. You're liked and respected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your style and preferences in this regard tend to be balanced - you don't like music that is super aggressive,
        nor too saccharine. Your style is pretty middle-of-the road in the best way.

        Friendly and sociable, you know how to be a good team player, like to help others in need, and are able to
        consider the needs of a group. You don't enjoy competing so much as you generally believe it's better to be
        happy than to be right.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, you tend to prefer cheerful, simple fashion that draws people in, non-aggressive music and
        feel-good films.

        Warm and sociable, tactful and polite, you're great at empathizing with the needs of other people. A team
        player, who is modest, and always willing to help someone in need, you're easily able to trust other people and
        don't get competitive. Better to be happy then be right, right?

        As a result, you like cheerful, friendly fashion that draws people in, such as florals or pastel colors,
        non-aggressive music, and feel-good films.
