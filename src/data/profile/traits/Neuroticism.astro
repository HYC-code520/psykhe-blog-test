        Wow, nothing gets you down. Using a rational approach to life, you're able to keep you emotions in check way
        better than most people, allowing you to focus on things that really matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you're so emotionally balanced, you prefer a simple style, entertaining films, and happy music. To you,
        fashion is more about looking professional, or in the right context, fun and self-expression, so you're not
        against a print.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, your preferences and lifestyle come from how your five scores work together - not from low neuroticism
        alone - creating an identity that's uniquely yours.

        You're a pretty happy soul, slow to anger, and able to keep calm in emotional situations much better than most
        people, allowing you to focus on practical matters. Your friends envy your stable nature. Sometimes, you
        struggle to understand more emotional people, but it's not your problem.

        Everything in moderation, including emotions, right? You're a balanced personality in terms of neuroticism, the
        trait responsible for making us feel sensitive and prone to the odd bad mood. This means that you benefit from
        some of its gifts, like being caring towards others, and being creative, but you're able to keep your emotions
        in check when it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you're moderate, you can swing towards darker hues or more cheerful colors, depending on your mood, but
        you also quite like mixing up your style for a contrast of both.

        You're on the sensitive side and probably worry a little bit more than most, but hey, you're also caring towards
        your friends and family, and have a strong creative streak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Led by feelings and intuition, you love emotional, meaningful music, film, and art. Your vulnerable nature also
        makes you love strong design and bold details when it comes to aesthetic. Fashion really is your armor, so you
        love darker looks and statement features.

        OK, you're sensitive and probably worry more than necessary, but hey, you're also extremely caring towards your
        friends, family, and colleagues. You're also powerfully creative. You can't be sensitive to detail, if you're
        not sensitive, period.

        You love emotional music, film, and art that moves you, and your vulnerable nature also makes you love strong
        design when it comes to your personal style. Fashion really is your armor, so you love dark, bolder looks and
