        paragraphs: [
            "A key component of most effective ecommerce marketing strategies, behavioral segmentation is a method that divides customers into smaller groups based on their actions and purchasing needs. Thinking beyond the traditional demographic and geographic segmentation methods, and using psychographic and behavioral data, allows for the execution of more intuitive, humanized marketing campaigns and recommendation AI. The process of effective behavioral segmentation allows you to create greater connection between people and the products they’ll love. Behavioral segmentation also allows for a more personalized online experience for the consumer, as well as increased brand loyalty.",

            "As the term suggests, behavioral targeting is the method of targeting consumers by their behavior and segmenting them in groups in order to deliver the most relevant ads and content to them. When undertaking behavioral targeting, customers are grouped based on activities and actions such as browsing behavior, pages visited, searches performed, links clicked, recency of visit, device used, geographic location, and products purchased.",
            "Visitors with similar behaviors are then grouped into defined audience segments, allowing retailers or advertisers to target them with specific, relevant ads and content based on their behavior. Behavioral targeting matters not only because the advertising is more likely to lead to a conversion, but it makes for a better, more personalized ecommerce experience. When carried out well, providing a sense of knowing to the consumer makes each interaction feel special.",

            "A common approach for executing product recommendations using machine learning, collaborative filtering looks at the collective set of preferences across users and items to learn from users that have similar behavior patterns. Recommendation systems collect both explicit data actively provided by users (such as numeric rating) and implicit data inferred by the system based on a user’s behavior (such as a preference for a certain product after viewing similar ones in the past). These massive datasets allow systems to craft predictions and serve relevant product recommendations tailored to users’ individual affinities and shopping behaviors.",

Computer vision uses deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual input, and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. A computer vision system uses large amounts of data that is analyzed over and over until it discerns distinctions and ultimately recognizes images. Computer vision is transforming ecommerce as it can identify products along with their characteristics such as color, size, shape, texture, print, and style.",

In contrast to collaborative filtering, content-based filtering does not require other users’ data to provide personalized recommendations to a user. This flexibility allows the system to provide highly specific recommendations to the current user, but it is also limited in the sense that it is unable to expand on known user interests.",

            "A standard pillar of an effective marketing strategy, customer segmentation is simply the technique of dividing a company's customers into groups that share a similarity among customers in each group. The overarching goal of customer segmentation is to be able to make decisions about how to engage with customers in each of the segments in order to maximize both the value to the customer, and of each customer to the company. When carrying out customer segmentation, companies can separate consumers by personality traits, psychographic data, certain interests, and habits, as well as a host of other demographic factors, such as where they live, their income levels, and age bracket.",

To achieve this, deep learning uses a multi-layered structure of algorithms called “neural networks”. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of neural networks are able to construct additional features in an automatic manner, instead of being manually designed by human engineers. In contrast to traditional machine learning, within ecommerce, deep learning uses an initial set of given features usually used to predict purchases (such as age, or region) to build more abstract and compressed features based on different combinations of those initial features. A growing technological field, deep learning is a core element when developing predictive modeling, building precise recommendation engines, and shaping personalized content.",

In this case, information about customers is compiled through software and systems that the organization itself owns. The organization can then use this data (demographics, purchase history, digital interactions, behavior, preferences, and so on) to deliver highly targeted experiences to users and increase brand loyalty. First-party data is considered to be one of the most valuable sources of user data because of its cost-effectiveness, accuracy, and relevance to the brand.",

Whereas standard automation usually occurs on a smaller scale, creating solutions that address individual tasks, hyperautomation encompasses multiple automation tools to really scale initiatives. As such, hyperautomation is perfect for maximizing productivity, efficiency, and accuracy within organizations. In addition, by delegating low-value and time-consuming tasks to bots, hyperautomation enables businesses to dedicate their attention to higher-value initiatives, such as understanding customer preferences and enhancing the customer experience.",

Macro-segmentation results in larger segments because it looks at broader attributes, but is better than no segmentation at all.

            "In the simplest terms, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are one-of-a-kind cryptographic assets that exist on a blockchain and cannot be reproduced. Due to their unique nature, NFTs cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. While fungible tokens, such as cryptocurrencies, are identical to each other and, therefore, mutually interchangeable, no two non-fungible tokens are not the same. In this way, non-fungible tokens enable the opportunity to generate one-off, highly valuable digital assets, such as digital artwork or digital fashion items, that can be tailored to consumer preferences.",
            "Presenting many opportunities, NFTs can be also used to represent real-word items, such as artwork or real estate. By converting a physical asset into a digital one, non-fungible tokens remove intermediaries and simplify transactions, which leads to increased efficiency and streamlined processes. As they cannot be copied or substituted, NFTs also reduce the probability of fraud.",

In essence, product tags are keywords, attributes, or qualities used for product identification within the website, which can range from the very broad to the ultra specific. For example, a fashion product can be tagged with a price category, brand, material, color, style, or psychographic property. In this way, product tags sort products by a certain feature and allow a specific, narrow product search so that products can be easily found by consumers. In ecommerce, product tagging must be consistent, updated, and accurate to enable relevant product search and discovery and a great customer experience.",
