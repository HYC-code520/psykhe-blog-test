                          Using a version of the Big 5 model of personality traits, we've calculated your scores below.
                          Within psychology, this model is the most trusted framework for measuring personality, and has
                          a known relationship with a variety of preferences.

                        <p>
                          Your core personal style is arrived at from how the five scores combine and interact together,
                          and not from one score alone, for an aesthetic and lifestyle that's uniquely yours.
